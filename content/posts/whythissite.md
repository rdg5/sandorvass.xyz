This is my fourth website. 

It started with the need of having an anchor on the Internet. Being someone who's job is being good with computers, it felt a basic need. After I got interested in the learning by building method I tried to find a technology that I wanted to learn to build my website/portfolio/whatever you call it.

There was one huge problem however. I didn't have anything to tell the world. I didn't want to blog or do anything fancy. I needed 3 sentences about myself, maybe a link to my Twitter account and that's it. Building this in svelte, react and vue.js felt like an overkill. I read a lot about state management about redux, sagas, thunk. About the very important concepts of each of these, but I didn't need to use them. My dream web page is literally html with a bit of css. And of course reading about these strange concepts and never using them in my project is not really *learning by building*. It's just learning. So in the last 1.5 years I put in a couple of weeks in learning any of these, building a web page that had three sentences and two links. Having it around for a couple of days and then deleting it because it always felt hilarious to have it Online.  

This is my fourth website.

It's written with Hugo. It was around 10 minutes to read through the documentation, figure out how the whole thing works and then create it. A couple of hours to figure out some errors during the deployment. 

This is my fourth website and it's going to stay around. What changed you might ask? In the last couple of years I spent a whole lot of my time learning new things. I'm perfecting the way I think about the world one book at a time. And I take a lot of notes.  Most of my notes now live in Roam which is an awesome tool for everyone. There is one problem with them, that they are private. And in the last couple of weeks I started to feel the urge to try and contribute to other people's knowledge base with mine. 

The whole idea comes from Nikita Voloboev who has shared his [knowledge wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) on his site.

My intention with this website besides having it as an anchor in the digital ocean is to host my wiki of knowledge that should be a curated version of my roam notes. ![process of writing](https://imgur.com/Oz5kUH6l.png)

My idea is to apply this concept from the world of books into my knowledge base, to have a double check on my ideas and things that I've learned or I put away as reference in roam.
